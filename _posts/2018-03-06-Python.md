# Python: Dungeon Crawl
In this assignment, the goal was to either make a Fortune Teller, Magic 8 Ball, or a game. I went the game route and created a short dungeron crawler style game.

Some of the Python ideas this game features are:
-Input/ Output
-Random Numbers
-Variables
-Conditionals
-Comparisons
-Concatenation
-Comments

## Can You Survive the Dungeon?
